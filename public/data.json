      "description": "Zelle® has partnered with leading banks and credit unions across the U.S. to bring you a fast, safe and easy way to send money to friends and family. Money moves quickly - directly from bank account to bank account. If your bank or credit union offers Zelle, you already have it in your mobile banking app or online banking – if they don’t, the Zelle app will make it easy for you to send money to enrolled Zelle users that already have access through their financial institution.\nZelle. This is how money moves®.\nUsing just your recipient’s email address or U.S. mobile number, you can settle up simply and safely with almost anyone you know and trust. Even better, Zelle does not charge any fees to use the service. (Mobile carrier or bank fees may apply).\nGET STARTED:\n1.\tDownload the Zelle app.\n2.\tEnroll using a Visa® or Mastercard® debit card linked to a U.S. checking account; or \n3.\tEnroll your U.S. checking account by using your online banking username and password, if your bank supports this feature*.\n4.\tChoose a person to pay, or request money from, by entering their U.S. mobile number or email address.\n5.\tConfirm the amount and hit send. If they’re already enrolled with Zelle, they’ll typically get the money in minutes. If they aren’t, they will be notified and can follow a few simple steps to complete the payment. \n\n*Some banks allow customers to enroll in the Zelle app using their online or mobile banking username and password.\n\nZelle and the Zelle related marks and logos are property of Early Warning Services, LLC\n\nYou must have a bank account in the U.S. to use Zelle.",

      "description": "Chime is the banking app that has your back. Keep your money safe with security features, overdraft up to $200 fee-free*, and get paid early with direct deposit^, with no monthly fees.\n\nChime is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by The Bancorp Bank or Stride Bank, N.A.; Members FDIC. The Chime Visa® Debit Card is issued by The Bancorp Bank or Stride Bank pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. The Chime Visa® Credit Builder Card is issued by Stride Bank pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. May be used everywhere Visa cards are accepted.\n\nTRUSTED BY MILLIONS\nStay in control of your money with instant transaction and daily balance alerts. Plus, enable two-factor authentication and block your card in a single tap.\n\nOVERDRAFT UP TO $200*\nWhen your balance is running low, the last thing you need is an overdraft fee. Eligible members on Chime can overdraft up to $200* on debit card purchases and ATM withdrawals fee-free.\n\nNO MONTHLY FEES\nChime has no monthly maintenance fees, minimum balance fees, or foreign transaction fees. Plus, access 60k+ fee-free‡ ATMs at locations like Walgreens, 7-Eleven, CVS, and more.\n\nGET PAID UP TO 2 DAYS EARLY\nGet your paycheck up to two days early^ with direct deposit, earlier than you would with some traditional banks.\n\nA NEW WAY TO BUILD CREDIT\nUse Credit Builder¹ to increase your FICO® Score by an average of 30 points² with regular on-time payments. No interest‡, no annual fees, no credit check to apply.\n\nPAY ANYONE WITH NO TRANSFER FEES\nSend money to friends and family fast as a text – with no transfer fees.\n–––––\n\n*Chime SpotMe is an optional, no fee service that requires a single deposit of $200 or more in qualifying direct deposits to the Chime Checking Account each month. All qualifying members will be allowed to overdraw their account up to $20 on debit card purchases and cash withdrawals initially, but may be later eligible for a higher limit of up to $200 or more based on member's Chime Account history, direct deposit frequency and amount, spending activity and other risk-based factors. Your limit will be displayed to you within the Chime mobile app. You will receive notice of any changes to your limit. Your limit may change at any time, at Chime's discretion. Although there are no overdraft fees, there may be out-of-network or third party fees associated with ATM transactions. SpotMe won't cover non-debit card transactions, including ACH transfers, Pay Anyone transfers, or Chime Checkbook transactions. See Terms and Conditions. Only SpotMe eligible members may send boosts.\n\n‡Out-of-network ATM withdrawal fees may apply except at MoneyPass ATMs in a 7-Eleven, or any Allpoint or Visa Plus Alliance ATM.\n\n^Early access to direct deposit funds depends on the timing of the submission of the payment file from the payer. We generally make these funds available on the day the payment file is received, which may be up to 2 days earlier than the scheduled payment date.\n\n¹Chime Checking Account and $200 qualifying direct deposit required to apply for the secured Chime Credit Builder Visa® Credit Card. See chime.com to learn more.\n\n²Based on a representative study conducted by Experian®, members who made their first purchase with Credit Builder between June 2020 and October 2020 observed an average FICO® Score 8 increase of 30 points after approximately 8 months. On-time payment history can have a positive impact on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score.\n\n³Based on Bankrate’s 2022 Checking Account and ATM Fee Survey: https://www.bankrate.com/banking/checking/checking-account-survey/\n\nChime received the highest 2021 Net Promoter Score among competitors in the industry according to Qualtrics®.\n\nAddress: 101 California Street, Suite 500, San Francisco, CA 94111, United States. \nNo customer support available at HQ.
